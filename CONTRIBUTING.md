# Contributing To The Project
## Thank You
Thank you so much for being willing to contribute to this project! Please feel free to fork the repository and contact me on my [support discord server](https://discord.gg/xXtuAQ2).

## Some Things To Know
- We use ZenHub to manage repository issues.
- Our highest priority issues will be put in the 'Next Release' pipeline.

## Process
- When you start working on something, move the task/improvement/bug into the 'In Progress' pipeline and assign it to yourself.
- When you're finished with something, move the associated issues into the 'Done' pipeline and open a pull request and assign it to yourself.
- When your pull request is reviewed and merged, close the associated issues.

## Caveats
- If you start working on something, please remember to assign yourself to the related issues so I know what is being worked on.
- If you assign yourself an epic, assign yourself all tasks under that epic.
- Only move an epic associated with one or more tasks into the 'In Progress' when all tasks left to do are assigned to you.

## Bugs
- When you encounter a bug that is in the code of the master branch, create an issue for it and assign it the 'Bug' label.
